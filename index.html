My parents raised me as a traveler. We took trips two to three times a year, while simultaneously moving states every two to four years. By the time I was 10, I had lived in six states and been to two countries. I took my first solo international trip at 15. <br>I spent my life as a career bartender. After COVID hit I found myself out of a job. I asked myself whether it was something that I want to spend the rest of my life doing. So, I took a road trip that lasted a couple of weeks. I began in Reno, Nevada and drove up to Seattle, Washington. I visited National Parks, caught up with old friends, and did some deep, deep soul searching. I came to the conclusion that bartending was not what I want to do with my life. <br>I spent many nights camping in National Forests. I went deep in the Sierra-Nevada mountains, pondering life and watching the embers of my fire dance. All alone, I listened to my thoughts as the wind whispered through the trees. This was the moment that I realized what I wanted to do, travel and see the world.</b> </p>
